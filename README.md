# Re:Twisted

I am not playing this game, so I won't be contributing actively (big bugs might be patched).

Contributions are appreciated.

[Discord server](https://discord.gg/yr7FsfGUXh) for suggestions and support

## Installation

1. Download the latest build from [releases](https://github.com/Okmada/ReTwisted/releases).
2. Download [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) (remember to change the path to Tesseract in settings if you have changed it).
3. Enjoy

## Running

Make sure you have the light theme in Roblox.

To have Roblox registered in the app, first start Roblox and then start the app.

Before starting the rolling, make sure you are on the title screen of Twisted (the screen where you have the big green button).

### How to get Roblox paths

1. Press Win + R and enter "shell:AppsFolder".
2. Drag and drop Microsoft Roblox and Roblox Player to the folder of your choice (you can't delete it, or it won't work anymore).
3. Then, for each, right-click the icon and press "copy" and paste it in settings.
