# Re:Twisted

I am not playing this game, so I won't be contributing actively (big bugs might be patched).

Contributions are appreciated.

[Discord server](https://discord.gg/yr7FsfGUXh) for suggestions and support

## Installation

1. Download the latest build from [releases](https://github.com/Okmada/ReTwisted/releases).
2. Download [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) (remember to change the path to Tesseract in settings if you have changed it).
3. Enjoy

## Running

- To have Roblox registered in the app, first start Roblox and then start the app.
